# Hi, I'm Jackol Lai

I am a transfer student of Arizona State University whose majoring in Graphic Information Technology; hopefully I will be graduating this year of 2026.

This is my first time learning about coding and my only experience to coding was completely the tutorial and trial lessons from Boot.dev; it's a little bit confusing but interesting

I enjoy gaming, designing, and going on walks with my dog
